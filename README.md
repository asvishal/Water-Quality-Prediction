ðŸ’§ Water Quality Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the potability of water using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a real-world dataset containing various water quality parameters and applies multiple classification models to determine whether the water is safe to drink.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
Explore and preprocess a dataset containing chemical and physical properties of water.

Build machine learning models to classify water as potable (safe) or non-potable.

Evaluate model performance and select the best performing algorithm.

ðŸ“Š Model Performance
Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers performed best with high accuracy and generalization on unseen data. The notebook contains plots and detailed performance metrics for comparison.
